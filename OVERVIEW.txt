PROJECT:Automated Cattle Feeder System using IoT
Presented by: DIVYA DHARSINI D
Institution: KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology
Project Guide: Dr. Jaikumar

OBJECTIVE:
The primary goal of this project is to build an automated cattle feeding system that delivers food and water to livestock 
at scheduled intervals. By automating this process, the system minimizes the need for manual involvement and increases the 
overall efficiency of farm operations, especially in larger or remote settings.

METHODOLOGY:
Step 1: Analyze the demand for automation in the cattle farming sector, particularly focusing 
on large farms and remote agricultural areas.
Step 2: Create an electronic circuit incorporating key components such as an Arduino board, 
a real-time clock (RTC) module, a relay, a servo motor, and a DC-powered water pump.
Step 3: Develop and upload a custom Arduino program to manage the coordination of feeding actions
based on time.
Step 4: Use the RTC module to define and maintain accurate feeding times.
Step 5: Connect the relay module to manage power to the DC pump for automatic 
water supply.
Step 6: Conduct multiple tests and iterations to ensure consistent and reliable performance of the 
feeding mechanism.

ROTOTYPE OVERVIEW:
Components Utilized: Arduino UNO, RTC module, servo motor for feed control, relay switch, and a DC water 
pump for hydration.
Feeding Mechanism: At the programmed time, the servo motor rotates to tilt and dispense food into the feeding tray.
Water Supply: Simultaneously, the relay triggers the pump to release water into a container.
Timing Logic: The system includes delay logic to ensure proper feeding cycles without overlap or repetition.
Expandability: The design can be scaled to serve multiple feeding stations, making it suitable for larger farms.
Future Enhancements: Incorporation of IoT-based controls and monitoring will allow farmers to adjust feeding schedules 
and monitor system status remotely via a smartphone or computer.
